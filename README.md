# Hello, World

## Description

This is a travel brochure application that highlights landmarks, noteworthy citizens and cities in New Zealand, Israel, Germany, and India. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flexbox, Git, and Github to build the application. The four HTML pages contain the framework for the pages but the content for the information cards comes from the Javascript files.

## In order to get started
Enter the following git commands inside your terminal.
1. Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:nss-day-cohort-44/hello-world-the-teal-archipelago.git`
2. Immediately create their first branch with `git checkout -b {initials-feature-your-working-on}`
3. Open your code by copying the following code and entering it in you terminal `code .`
4. Remember to do a commit often by entering `git commit -m "what you did in your code"` inside your terminal 
5. NEVER WORK DIRECTLY ON MASTER BRANCH!

## Dynamically Making Files
To dynamically create files, each page has its own its script directory with 3 subdirectories: cities, landmarks, and citizens. Each subdirectory has two files, one data provider and one to create the list. Each list file is calling upon its specific data provider and a common card creator module to fully create the needed html.
